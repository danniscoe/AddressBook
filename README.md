# AddressBook


Java Address Book Project:

In this project, I will be creating an address book that can store information about people.

Overall Goals

The application should be able to do the following:
  Present the user with a list of options to interact with the database and take in their input
  Allow the user to perform the following actions:
  Add an entry
  Remove and entry
  Search for a specific entry
  Print the contents of the address book
  Delete the contents of the address book
  Quit the program
  
  *This is a work in progress.  I still have a lot of code to write, and bugs to work out*
